<p id="description">This project is all about analyzing IMDb movie reviews to understand the emotions and sentiments hidden in them. Using advanced machine learning techniques particularly a BiLSTM neural network we‚Äôve developed a model that doesn‚Äôt just classify reviews as positive or negative but also digs deeper into specific aspects like acting music and storytelling.</p>
